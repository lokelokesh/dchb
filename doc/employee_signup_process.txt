After searching:
- I should see a list of matching employers, that correspond to unlinked roster employees

When I select an employer:
- My person, family, and employee role should be created/linked, and my user linked
- Data for these objects will be selected based on the hierarchy of data importance:
  Personal Information:
    1) Search form data
    2) Glue
    3) Selected roster entry
  Family Structure:
    1) Glue
    2) Dependents in employee roster
- Create an open shopping period for that employee, either due to:
  + Current open enrollment period
  + A new hire QLE (this will be determined from the roster entry)
